# ChestXRay-NIH
Analysing Chest X-ray Data
The challenge in this project is to build an algorithm to identify through the chest X-ray images whether a patient is suffering from Cardiomegaly which is one of the 14 Common Thorax Disease Categories, namely;  Atelectasis, Cardiomegaly,  Effusion,  Infiltration, Mass, Nodule, Pneumonia, Pneumothorax, Consolidation, Edema,  Emphysema, Fibrosis, Pleural_Thickening or Hernia. We need an extremely accurate algorithm as this will lead to  peoples lives.
The reason for selecting Cardiomegaly  is because it is one of a non-physician seemed tractable which is to look for a big heart in a patient. It will a good quick and reliable confirmation of the model of a layman.
